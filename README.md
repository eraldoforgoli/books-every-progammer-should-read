# Books every progammer should read

List of books that i have read and i suggest that every programmer should read.

**For each folder, there is a README.md. This folder contains my personal notes while reading these books + notes i have taken by reading blogs.**

### TODO

- [x] Share the notes for each book
- [ ] Add more books
- [x] Structure the project into one folder per book, including notes and explanation.
