# Books every progammer should read

List of books that i have read and i suggest that every programmer should read.

# Clean Architecture

This book is a must, if you want to create an architecture that is:

1. Independent of Frameworks
2. Testable
3. Easily scalable
4. Independent of Database.

In my opinion (having seen different approaches to building applications), this type of architecture is the cleanest and the one that sets you free from 'dependencies'.
I will share the full notes on this on the next version of this project.

# Clean Code

One of the masterpieces of Uncle Bob, highly recommended for craftsman.
I agree with almost everything that Uncle Bob writes in this book.
This book will teach you the art of writing clean code.

# Pro Git

If you work with people other than yourself, having at least the basic knowledge about git is a must.

# Introduction To Algorithms

I started learning this book, but did not have the time to finish it, but highly recommend.
This book (along with data structures is on my top priorities).
