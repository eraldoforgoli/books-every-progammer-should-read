# Clean Architecture

This book is a must, if you want to create an architecture that is:

1. Independent of Frameworks
2. Testable
3. Easily scalable
4. Independent of Database.

In my opinion (having seen different approaches to building applications), this type of architecture is the cleanest and the one that sets you free from 'dependencies'.
I will share the full notes on this on the next version of this project.
